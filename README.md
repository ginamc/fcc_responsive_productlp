# Product Landing Page - freeCode Camp | Responsive Web Design Project #3

The objective of this project was to build a product landing page similar in functionality [to the FCC example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/eGeoxL). Emphasis of this project was to test HTML and CSS skills as covered in the curriculum.

## How to Use
You can [visit my CodePen app here](https://codepen.io/ginamc/pen/bZKwMK) and play with the landing page. The to navigation is linked to 3 anchors on the page, and the email submission form will take you to a pre-made Freecode Camp page that acts as an indicator that your submission was successful.

## Project Requirements

_From Freecode Camp_
- User Story #1: My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
- User Story #2: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
- User Story #3: Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
- User Story #4: I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
- User Story #5: When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
- User Story #6: I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".
- User Story #7: My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
- User Story #8: Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
- User Story #9: The #email input field should have placeholder te-t to let the - user know what the field is for.
- User Story #10: The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered te-t is an email address.
- User Story #11: Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
- User Story #12: When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully.
